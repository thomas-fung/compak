Description: Discrete associated kernel smoother for estimating probability mass functions using the mean-parametrised Conway-Maxwell-Poisson (COMP) distribution. Two automated bandwidth selection approaches, one based on minimizing Kullback-Leibler divergence and another based on cross-validation, are also implemented.
